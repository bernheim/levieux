    <p>On the most eastern quarters of Entre-Deux-Mers, the Château Labatut is most certainly one of the most beautiful residences of a region renowned for its architectural wealth. Once the demure of the Seigneurs of Duras, it was built during the Hundred Years’ War. Two impressive defence towers dating back to the 15th century frame the castle’s elegant architecture and grant a view of the sun-soaked, clay-limestone terroir spanning 45 hectares.</p>
    <p>Rooted for over more than two centuries on the Bordelais high lands, this vineyard soaks up full southern exposure and benefits from the land’s naturally excellent irrigation. Underlying a layer of clay rich in iron ore, the terroir is made up of fossil-filled maritime limestone. This warm and early-blooming terroir is favourable to the main varietals of Labatut: Cabernet Franc and Sauvignon.</p>
    <p>Planted contiguously around the Château, the 33 hectares of vineyard flourish under our undivided attention. A model of the French national action plan for the reduction of pesticide use (Ecophyto) the vines are cared for sustainably using short pruning, grass covering, de-budding, de-leafing and green harvesting if necessary. Late mechanical harvesting with the most recent tools ensures top quality selection during harvest. Considerable restructuring of the vineyard was initiated in 2000 to obtain a planting density of 5000 stocks per hectare.</p>
