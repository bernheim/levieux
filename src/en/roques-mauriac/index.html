    <p>The Château ROQUES MAURIAC to the east of the Bastide de Sauveterre de Guyenne is a rather recent construction, built at the beginning of the 20th century. It is a lovely domain nestled in the heart of Entre-Deux-Mers. This elegant demure is surrounded by 50 hectares of vineyards; its clay-limestone terroir rivals its prestigious neighbours of the Saint-Emilion region. Its remarkable barrel chai houses two monumental frescos.</p>
    <p>The Château Roques Mauriac vineyard grows in very favourable conditions: high density planting (4000 to 5000 stocks per hectare) on one of the highest plateaus of l’Entre-Deux-Mers. The soil is made up of excellent quality, very pure clay on a flush underlying layer of maritime limestone. A geological makeup made renowned by a prestigious neighbour- the Saint-Emilion plateau.</p>
    <p>This unique terroir heavily influenced the choice of varietal planting, with a rather atypical predominance given to Cabernet Franc (48% of the vineyard in red), a reputedly difficult varietal but capable of producing infinitely elegant wines.</p>
    <p>The 45 hectares of vineyard flourish under our undivided attention. A model of the French national action plan for the reduction of pesticide use (Ecophyto) the vines are cared for sustainably using short pruning, grass covering, de-budding, de-leafing and green harvesting if necessary. Late mechanical harvesting with the most recent tools ensures top quality selection during harvest.</p>
