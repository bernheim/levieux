    <p>For almost two centuries, the 3 traditional Bordeaux varietals (Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon) grow in the Château Lagnet vineyard. They are planted contiguously on gently sloping hillsides and rounded hilltops, benefiting from full southern exposure and naturally irrigated soil. The rather dense clay terroir on an underlying layer of fossil-rich limestone is particularly favourable to the development of the Merlot grape, the predominant varietal of Lagnet.</p>
    <p>The 29 hectares of vineyard flourish under our undivided attention. A model of the French national action plan for the reduction of pesticide use (Ecophyto) the vines are cared for sustainably using short pruning, grass covering, de-budding, de-leafing and green harvesting if necessary. Late mechanical harvesting with the most recent tools ensures top quality selection during harvest. Considerable restructuring of the vineyard was initiated in 2003 to obtain a planting density of 5000 stocks per hectare.</p>
    <p>Owned by the Saint-Gassies family for more than 400 years, the Château Lagnet is a charming demure framed by two 16th century towers. The domain abounds with fresh water sources and has a stunning washhouse, constructed in the 17th century. The château also showcases a fantastic collection of old tools, relics from the region’s rich agricultural heritage.</p>
